# PlotBot

A bot that sends out visualized sentiment analysis of a Twitter account's recent tweets. The bot receives tweets via mentions and in turn performs sentiment analysis on the most recent twitter account specified in the mention.

For example, when a user tweets, "@alf7tf Analyze: @CNN", it will trigger a sentiment analysis on the CNN twitter feed.

A plot from the sentiment analysis is then tweeted to the @alf7tf twitter feed.
